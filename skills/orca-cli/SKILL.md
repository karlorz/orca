name: orca-cli
description: >-
  Operate Orca-managed worktrees, folder contexts, terminals, repos, automations, artifacts,
  skill sharing, worktree comments, and Orca's embedded browser through the `orca` CLI. Use
  when the user says "$orca-cli", "Orca worktree", "child worktree", "spawn codex/claude in a
  worktree", "read/wait/send Orca terminal", "handoff" / "handover" / "give this to another
  agent", "Orca browser", "orca artifacts", or "share skills". Prefer it over raw git
  worktree, ad hoc PTYs, or Computer Use when Orca state is involved. Use Computer Use only
  when a visible window needs GUI control that a CLI, filesystem, or API cannot do.

# Orca CLI

This discovery stub loads the version-matched guide from the Orca executable used for this session.

## Resolve the CLI for this session

Choose the executable once and reuse it for every later command:

- If the `ORCA_CLI_COMMAND` environment variable is set, use its value. Orca exports this
  for managed WSL sessions.
- Otherwise, in a dev checkout whose session exposes `ORCA_DEV_REPO_ROOT`, use `orca-dev`.
- Otherwise, on Linux outside an Orca-managed terminal, use `orca-ide`. Never run bare
  `orca` there — outside Orca's terminals it normally resolves to the
  GNOME Orca screen reader (`/usr/bin/orca`) and starts speech on the user's machine.
- Otherwise, use `orca`.

Below, `ORCA` is a placeholder for the executable you resolved. Substitute it before
running anything; do not create a shell variable or run `ORCA` literally. This works the
same way in POSIX shells, PowerShell, and cmd.exe.

If the selected executable cannot run, report its exact error and stop. Do not fall through
to another executable, which could silently target a different Orca build.

## Load the version-matched guide before running Orca commands

```text
ORCA skills get orca-cli
```

Prefer `--json`. Use the selected executable's `--help` for commands or flags the guide does
not cover. If a command reports that Orca is not running, start it with `ORCA open --json`
and retry. If it fails with `runtime_access_denied`, your sandbox blocked the connection:
re-run it with escalated permissions, and do not run `ORCA open` or restart Orca. If
`skills get` is unknown, explain that updating Orca restores the guide; use `--help` for
read-only discovery and do not guess unsupported commands.

## Verify the target before launching work

For a named repository/workspace, discover its full ID with `ORCA worktree list
--json`, inspect it with `ORCA worktree show --worktree id:<full-id> --json`, and
pass that exact selector to the launch. Check host, path, and branch (when Git).
Do not infer placement from shell cwd or absolute paths in the task prompt.
In particular, orchestration `--worktree current` means the coordinator's
recorded workspace, which can differ from `worktree current` and shell cwd.
Use exact placement when they differ; do not change caller identity to force it.
Verify the returned workspace and handle before follow-up work; the worker must
verify its own cwd/workspace before editing. A mismatch is a recovery condition,
not permission to keep working through absolute paths or launch a duplicate.
This guard also applies when an older bundled guide uses `current` examples.
Coordinator identity (`ORCA_TERMINAL_HANDLE`, `run-use`, `run-show`) lives in the
orchestration skill; load that guide before `run-create`.
